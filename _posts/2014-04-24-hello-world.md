It has been a long journey for me to actually implement the idea of setting up a website of my own and voila, it has become a reality! I would like to thank my instincts and my friends for the motivation and support. This would not have been possible without the help of web guru Jaijin Paulose. His contribution is tremendous to make this happen. He is the CEO & founder of [dezignEx][1] and a well-wisher of mine. The acknowledgment also goes to my brother and well-wisher Vishnu, who provided me with tons of wonderful ideas to start this site even though he had no idea what this would be all about.

I have done a lot of research in setting this site right from the design, content management and learnt a lot of new concepts being embedded into the website. It was a fun-ride for me exploring yet another side of technology. I would recommend everyone to give a try in blogging. It is a good approach towards knowing yourself and exposing yourself to the world. No matter what the blog is about, there are always people looking out for something new in the world. Who can say, maybe someday your article could be published somewhere for its quality of contents. So consider this as my tip#1 for the journey in life.

In this blog, I would like to share my thoughts on geeky stuff like programming, electronics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, some of my project works and so on… Along with this, I will be adding some cool stuffs like designing, adventures, treks and so on… I am sure that you would find a variety of posts with some motivational and inspirational articles. I will make it a point that if I use any content which is not of my own I will give proper acknowledgment and source links. Right now, I am still in the formulation of the contents and structure of this site. Please have a little patience till the complete action begins :)

Wishing you all a wonderful day! Thank you :)

Cheers,
Vishal
