As I was learning bits and pieces of Machine learning, just to cut out the serious deal I wrote a poem about the same. Hope you’ll enjoy it...

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Oh Data! my data<br /> I am just a skeleton without you<br /> you fill me up with attributes and features<br /> and poke me with sigma and pi<br /> the world runs fine if we are together,<br /> ours is a bonding if broken, fails!<br /> Oh Data! my data<br /> together we both can build a world<br /> we stand as guides for hazy people<br /> they learn from our relation<br /> and wait for our recommendation<br /> ours is a bonding if broken, fails!<br /> They confuse us with ambiguity<br /> but we still go on with our probability<br /> they train hard and test hard<br /> we just love it more to bond together<br /> Gaussian and Bayesian are our friends<br /> they help in finding our right chemistry<br /> fights and errors happens often<br /> but root mean square finds the justice<br /> Oh Data! my data,<br /> ours is a bonding if broken, fails!
