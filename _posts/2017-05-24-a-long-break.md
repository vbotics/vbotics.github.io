It has been a long break since December 2014 until May 2017. I haven't been able to update the blog as a lot of things were happening in my life. Hopefully, I would like to fill those gap with some informative posts on what I learned during those time.

For a quick overview of my timeline since then:

- 2014 : Finished my graduation moved to Leeds, UK

- 2015 : Completed my post graduation from University of Leeds and worked in a research group called "Smart-bio Leg" for 6 months

- 2016 : Returned back to India, joined TeamIndus. We are on a mission to send spacecraft and a rover to the moon. Check www.teamindus.in

- 2017 : Still working on the GLXP. And further updates can be found on the future posts.

I'll be posting my experience and journey in this blog. Hopefully, I will try to keep this blog alive.

Cheers,
  
Vishal
