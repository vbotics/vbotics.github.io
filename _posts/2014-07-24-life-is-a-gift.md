Every day we wake up, eat, chat, sleep and mostly spend our days just like that. What we almost forget in this life is the beautiful opportunity which we miss in lives without our consciousness. It is a fact that we are so unaware of the happenings in the world. But I do not mean that an individual should know exactly what is happening all around us because it is not possible for us to grasp every single detail in the life.

Yes, I guess now most of you are wondering what am I trying to explain with this “awareness”? It is a simple answer and it is “life”. We need to realize that we humans are capable of doing a lot more than what we think could be done. This particular gift is only available exclusively for “homo sapiens”. Thanks to evolution and the life process. To explain that let us compare ourselves with the common living organisms such as animals. (It is a fact that even humans are animals but, we humans are super animals. With the usage of super I do not mean that we are superior to any other living organism.) Here it is a comparison of the gift of capability of us humans with normal animals.

Let us take the example of a hardworking ant which are the most civil living organism. These ants are capable of working all day long and plan their life according to the situation and surroundings. In simple terms, they work hard during the summer and store the food in a safe storage to survive in the winter(hard times). Isn’t that beautiful? They keep doing their task like a while loop in programming which runs infinitely until the ant dies. This kind of routine is the basic framework for almost every living organism and hence proves the “survival of the fittest”. Take a bee, polar bear, python etc., what ever the living organism maybe the background and living conditions change but the framework remains the same.

Now, us the human beings! We can do the same things which are mentioned above. This is naturally inherited from nature. Hence no big deal to that. We will live no matter what the condition is. Our biological architecture is so complex and wonderful that we can do any task as we wish. Don’t agree with me? Well, lets explore more into that! If we compare the humans with other organisms I can tell you that it can be of two types:

1. Normal mode

2. Overclocking mode

In the normal mode, we are more like the basic living organisms which we saw above with very simple tasks in our life. We tend not to make anything extraordinary. We try to be a part of the society which is well established and continue without giving any major contribution. We are more in a dormant kind of life style. Here we are more used the world of “settlement”. Hence, the life goes on cool, good and just like that.

In the Overclocking mode, we are realizing the fact that we are the people with special gifts we can utilize at the most during our lifetime. Hence, an individual tries to think outside the box. This does not mean that one should start a new world and bring out a completely awkward situation. It should be taken in a positive attitude and realize the power of our “mind”. We humans can simulate things which are not even dreamable to others. Our complexities can make things a lot easier. We can reach fathoms when we overclock ourselves. If we think of a term “settlement” then its like a period (.) in the growth of life. We shut down all our doors and try to run the infinite loop again and again throughout our life. Where as when we overclock ourselves, the single loop will keep on running without an end hence there won't be any repetitions in life process.

I do not mean that everyone should keep their living mode as “Overclocking mode” because it will wear you out. Hence, hold a pause then and there to get back to normal and once you feel it is time to get back to over-clocking jump right in where you left out!

For the beautification, just think how wonderful it would have been if people worked together for a better World. Not in their “own” world. We belong to nature and hence it is our duty to contribute back to nature. Not when we are dead and contribute our ashes to nature, but while we live and contribute to the good of the people and nature. Then there wouldn’t be any kid starving in the streets, any old age people begging for their survival.

Just think of the limitless contribution which can do in our lifetime. After all, that is what is the meaning of living. Contribute in every field which are good at. Teach the illiterate, let the kids grow with strong positive motives, let there be awareness of life while we live. There is nothing which are going to do when we go to heaven or hell. It is right now and now is the time to do things which only “we” each individual is capable of doing. If we don’t then, whom are you expecting to do? I don’t need to be an expert or should have a gold medal to contribute good to the society.

It seems a lot while reading this. But I am not asking you all to stop what you are doing and start up some new revolution. Just think of it and help yourself digesting the simple facts of our lives. Everyone in this universe is bound to contribute something to this universe. So why don’t we just let it go as a free dollar and instead make that each dollar counts for a bigger good?

I would like to conclude this with a quote from Gita “Lokha Samastha Sukhino Bhavantu :” Let there be peace!
