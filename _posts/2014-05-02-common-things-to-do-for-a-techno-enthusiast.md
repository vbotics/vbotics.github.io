In this post I would like to share with you some tips which are needed to all the aspirants of technology to keep updated and have fun with it. ¬†A person who creates new things/gadgets to make the life simpler for fellow beings is an engineer. He/she is the creator of technology. As I am an engineer, I personally feel that most of the engineers lack in being an engineer but he/she an expert in every other field.¬†For all those engineering aspirants and people out there who would like to be a techno-enthusiast, here is a Getting Started guide:

**Just Dream**
  
First and the foremost thing needed for being a techno enthusiast is the urge and hunger for technology. Get fascinated by all the technology out there. Wonder how automation works. Look out for new types of robots in the world. Watch super cool sci-fi movies and dream about them. Well that is just for the trailer! Dream a lot about how your fantasy world looks like, make a picture of it. And now comes the real part‚Ä¶

**Get Dirty**
  
Make your hands dirty playing with electronics and the things which you like the most. All day reading and learning won‚Äôt make you any good unless you get a practical experience. It is very necessary that you go out there to the electronic shop (now you can buy online!) making a list of components needed for your mini project. Yes it will be an interesting experience! Ten 1k ohm resistors, five 10 micro Farad capacitors, six LED, battery, microcontrollers, wires etc‚Ä¶ You‚Äôll get a feeling of buying the super cool grocery üòÄ This will make you aware of new products out there in the market so that next time you can use an efficient component for your project.

**Get inspired**
  
There are lots of help out there in the internet. There goes an old saying that, ‚ÄúOnly the crying baby gets the milk‚Äù. Yes you need to search out for projects done by many electronic enthusiasts. [Instructables][1] is wonderful website which I would recommend you all to look into if you are really interested in DIY(Do It Yourself) stuffs. It will help you keeping engaged with your field of interest. Also you could avoid doing mistakes with these guides so that you can keep smiling throughout the project. Upon successful completion of the project you may post your work online so that in future someone in some corner of the world would need it.

It‚Äôs a really short guide though it will keep you engaged in the tech-sphere. Hope you all enjoyed it. Do let me know your comments and suggestions about how you feel about the same. Thank you üôÇ
